            <p  class="Me1">HELLO</p>
            <p  class="Me2">I am Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Scuderia Ferrari and Ferrari S.p.A..
                My passion for speed and innovation shaped the world of motorsport.
                Born in 1898, I started as a racing driver before building legendary cars.
                I created Ferrari to dominate Formula 1 and craft the finest road machines.
                For me, a car is not just metal—it's emotion, power, and art.
                Even today, my legacy lives on in every prancing horse on the road.  </p>
